questions to ask:
1) do I need cross support beams?
2) do I need glazing bars? how many?, can I get away with just one?
3) what do I put between timber and the pc sheets? How do I align between rafters?
4) what finish on the timber to get a natural look with little maintenance?
5) do I really need 5% pitch?
6) do I need mounting plates on both sides of rafters?
